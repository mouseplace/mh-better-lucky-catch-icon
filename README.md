# 🐭️ MouseHunt - Better Lucky Catch Icon

A Userscript for [MouseHunt](https://mousehuntgame.com) to upscale the lucky catch icon so it isn't so blurry.

> [!TIP]
> You should install [MouseHunt Improved](https://github.com/MHCommunity/mousehunt-improved) instead of this script, as it includes this functionality and tons more!

## Installation

Install via [GreasyFork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/449493-mousehunt-better-lucky-catch-icon).

*You must have [ViolentMonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) or another userscript manager installed.*
